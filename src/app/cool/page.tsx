      I was born in Montpellier, France but left to go live in Iran when I was just 1. Two years ago when I went to study abroad in GTE, I took my only solo trip to step into that house again after 20 years. I knocked and the people who were currently living there let me come in and see it. It was an extremely surreal experience and I thought it was extremely cool.
